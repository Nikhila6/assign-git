Compiled class file - *.class
Log file - *.log

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Git does a fast forward when you merge a branch that is ahead of your checked-out branch. If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest comit of the feature branch. There wont be any merge commit in fast-forwarding merge.

• Why should you have different branches?
To work on multiple user stories or tasks simultaneously and also to make sure that new changes will not effect the working software in the master branch

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
We can have multiple repositories.There will be default remote named origin created by git when you clone an existing repositories.
We can configure a second remote, push to/pull from that remote.
